Introduction to Python-
Python is an object-oriented programming language created by Guido Rossum in 1989. 
It is ideally designed for rapid prototyping of complex applications.
It has interfaces to many OS system calls and libraries and is extensible to C or C++. 
Many large companies use the Python programming language include 
NASA, Google, YouTube, BitTorrent, etc.

Characteristics of Python
It provides rich data types and easier to read syntax than any other programming languages
It is a platform independent scripted language with full access to operating system API's
Compared to other programming languages, it allows more run-time flexibility
It includes the basic text manipulation facilities of Perl and Awk
A module in Python may have one or more classes and free functions
Libraries in Pythons are cross-platform compatible with Linux, MacIntosh, and Windows
For building large applications, Python can be compiled to byte-code
Python supports functional and structured programming as well as OOP
It supports interactive mode that allows interacting Testing and debugging of snippets of code
In Python, since there is no compilation step, editing, debugging and testing is fast.

Python used for
Programming video games
Artificial Intelligence algorithm
Programming various scientific programs such as statistical models
In this series, we will cover Python 3 Examples.
